How Do You Play Pig Dice Game?
Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn’t roll a 1. 
The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

How Do You Win The Game?
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
